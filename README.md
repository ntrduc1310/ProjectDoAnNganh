# Work Assignment and Load Balancing Support System

This is a capstone project aimed at building a system that supports automatic work assignment and load balancing, helping teams and organizations manage and distribute tasks efficiently among members. The project is fully developed in Java.

## Project Objectives

- Automatically assign tasks based on individual member capabilities, workload, and work history.
- Ensure balanced workload distribution, avoiding overload or idleness.
- Support progress tracking, status updates, and comprehensive reporting.
- Enhance team efficiency and minimize the risk of delays.

## Main Features

- **Member Management**: Add, edit, or remove members; track skills and work history.
- **Task Management**: Create, edit, categorize, and prioritize tasks.
- **Automatic Assignment**: Use load-balancing algorithms for optimal task distribution.
- **Progress Tracking**: Update task status and generate overall progress reports.
- **User-friendly Interface**: (If available) Intuitive UI for easy operation.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: (Please add if any, e.g., JavaFX, Spring Boot, Hibernate, etc.)
- **Database**: (Add if used, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Source Control**: Git & GitHub

## üéØ Load Balancing Algorithms

The system implements multiple sophisticated algorithms for optimal task distribution:

### 1. **Round Robin with Skill Matching**
- Distributes tasks evenly across team members
- Prioritizes users with matching skill sets
- Considers current workload as tie-breaker

### 2. **Weighted Round Robin**
- Assigns tasks based on user capacity and experience
- Calculates weighted scores considering:
  - Current workload percentage
  - Skill match accuracy
  - Historical performance

### 3. **Priority-Based Assignment**
- High-priority tasks go to most experienced members
- Normal tasks use load balancing approach
- Emergency tasks override normal distribution

### 4. **Intelligent ML-like Assignment**
- Uses multi-factor scoring algorithm
- Considers skill match (40%), workload (30%), experience (20%), priority alignment (10%)
- Self-improving based on task completion patterns
